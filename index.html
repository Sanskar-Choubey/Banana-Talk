        </header>

        <p class="content">
            We have all seen the Despicable Me Series—and loved them, mainly because of the tiny, yellow, bespectacled
            creatures called <span style="font-weight: bold;">Minions</span>.
        </p>

        <p class="content">
            Speaking like a Minion isn’t only a matter of making incomprehensible sounds with words from different languages
            thrown in frequently. If observed carefully, Minionese has a lot of resemblance with baby-talk. Anyone who has
            heard babies cooing in the first years of development will notice that they speak the alphabets “B” and “P” a
            lot—as do Minions when they say “ba-na-na”, talking in cute little voices with uplifting tones. Just like babies
            do.
