# Banana-Talk


This is my fisrt <strong>WEB App</strong> based on <strong>Vanilla JS , HTML and CSS.</strong>.
This app will demonstrate how to integrate the API with the JavaScript.
Also this app will tell you that how the <i>network calls,error handling</i> works in JS.

In short this is a short implementation of Client-Server Architecture based app where the end user acts as CLient and API act as server.
